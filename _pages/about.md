**Looking for Computer Science PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.**

I am a senior Computer Science student at The Ohio State University, fortunately advised by Dr. [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao/home). I also work closely with Dr. [Jianyang Gu](https://vimar-gu.github.io/).

I am interested in Trustworthy AI, LLM, multimodal learning and interdisciplinary AI applications.

You can find my [CV](/assets/pdf/YifanLiu_CV.pdf) here (11/2025).
